function metrics = metric_evaluation(TestMasksDir, SegmentedMaskDir)
% AUTHOR: Mariachiara Stellato (E-mail: mariachiarastellato@gmail.com)
% FUNCTION DESCRIPTION: 
%   this function takes as inputs a folder containing the mask you consider your ground truth and 
%   another folder containing the masks segmented with one semantic segmentation network. 
%   It gives as an output a structure containing various computed
%   metrics that evaluate the quality of the semantic segmentation. 
% INPUTS:
%   TestMaskDir:                 string containing the directory of the
%                                folder containing the ground truth masks. 
%   SegmentedMaskDir:            string containing the directory of the
%                                folder containing the mask segmented with the semantic segmentation network.
% OUTPUTS:
%   metrics:                     structure containing the computed
%                                metrics for evaluating the quality of the network.
