# SpheroidSegmentation_With_ResNet101

This repository contains functions implemented in MATLAB for training various segmentation neural networks, for spheroid segmentation using the trained neural networks and for evaluating the quality of the segmentation performed. 
This code is included in the AnaSP software that is free to download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/anasp/
The implemented segmentation networks that are trainable are VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet50 and ResNet101.
