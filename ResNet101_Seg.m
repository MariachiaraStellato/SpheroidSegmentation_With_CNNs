function lgraph = ResNet101_Seg(ImageSize,NumClasses)
% AUTHOR: Mariachiara Stellato (E-mail: mariachiarastellato@gmail.com)
% FUNCTION DESCRITPION: 
%   This function will create a segmentation neural network based on the
%   convolution neural network called ResNet101.
%
% INPUTS: 
%   ImageSize:      [a b] numerical array containing the size of the images 
%                   that will be used for the training 
%   NumClasses:     integer that specigy the number of classes for which
%                   the network will be trained. 
% OUTPUT: 
%   lgraph:         lgraph containing the connected layers that form the
%                   segmentation network
